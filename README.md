# Stay-Stable

this project is seperated to 3 parts:

1) application
2) server
3) arduino


   application:
   the application is built using react-native made for android/iphone.
   the app is the way of our users to watch all the data the server has analysed, as well as inputing data.


   server:
   the server is built using python flask.
   in the server we interact with both the bracelet and the application as well as working with db.

   arduino:
   the arduino is built for shaking detection and fall detection for parkinson patiants.
   the appliance is built to try and help those patiants to track their status and decide how much medicine they should take.
